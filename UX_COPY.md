## 7. Tooltip Explanations (Compound Interest Concepts)

### 7.1 Core Concepts

**What is Interest?** ℹ️
```
Interest is money you earn just for saving!

Think of it like a thank-you gift. When you keep 
your money in GrowBucks, it earns a little extra 
every single day. Free money! 🎁
```

**What is Compound Interest?** ℹ️
```
Here's where it gets cool! 🌟

Compound interest means you earn interest on 
your interest! 

So tomorrow, you earn money on today's earnings too. 
It's like a snowball rolling downhill — 
it keeps getting bigger!
```

**What is My Daily Rate?** ℹ️
```
Your daily rate is how much your money grows each day.

If your rate is 1%, and you have $100, 
you'll earn $1 tomorrow!

Then you'll have $101, and THAT earns interest too.
```

**Why Does My Balance Keep Changing?** ℹ️
```
Your money is growing right now! 🌱

Every second, you're earning a tiny bit more. 
We show you the real-time growth so you can 
watch the magic happen!
```

**What Happens If I Take Money Out?** ℹ️
```
Taking money out is totally fine! It's YOUR money.

But here's the thing: less money = less growth.
The more you keep in, the faster it grows.

Something to think about! 🤔
```

### 7.2 Dashboard Tooltips

**"Earned Today" Tooltip**
```
This is how much your money made TODAY! ✨

Your savings worked hard while you 
played, slept, or did homework.
```

**"Earned This Week" Tooltip**
```
All your earnings from the last 7 days!

See how it adds up when you keep saving?
```

**"Total Earnings" Tooltip**
```
Every single penny your money has ever earned! 🏆

This is all extra money you got 
just for being a great saver.
```

**"Growth Rate" Tooltip** (Child)
```
This is your daily growth percentage.

{rate}% might seem small, but it adds up fast!
```

**"Days Until Goal" Tooltip**
```
At your current savings rate, 
this is when you'll hit your goal! 🎯

Save more, and you'll get there even faster.
```

### 7.3 Calculator/Projector Tooltips

**"What If" Section**
```
Curious what happens if you save more? 

Type in a number and see how fast you'll grow!
```

**"Save vs. Spend" Comparison**
```
This shows what you'd have if you 
DIDN'T take that money out.

It's okay to spend! But it's cool to see 
what saving does too.
```
